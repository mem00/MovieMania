# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
movies-app/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
movies-app/log/*
movies-app/tmp/*
movies-app/!/log/.keep
movies-app/!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development
movies-app/storage/*
movies-app/!/storage/.keep

movies-app/.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
movies-app/config/master.key
